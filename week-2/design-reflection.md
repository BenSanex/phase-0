What are the 6 phases of web design?

    1. Information Gathering - Define the purpose of the site and what type of content you will have on the site
    2. Planning - Develop a site map, which includes what you're putting on the site and the page hierarchy
    3. Design - Start developing prototypes for the site, either just images or working prototypes
    4. Development - Write the code and put the site together
    5. Testing and Delivery - Try the different pages and features of the site and then get it to the host and put it online
    6. Maintenance - Keep the website current by updating and adding new content
    
What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?

    The primary goal of my site is for people to be able to learn more about me! It will feature things like my projects and links to my social networking sites.

What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?

    My target audience should be interested in finding out if I'm a valuable person to have on their team, and I want to address that by providing as much good information and as many good examples as I can.

What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.

    I want them to see my portfolio and contact me somehow.

What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?

    You have to balance what you want to the user to do and how they feel when they are using your site.

What is user experience design and why is it valuable? 

    If people don't have a positive experience when they use your site then they won't want to use it again.  Most websites won't be successful without repeat visitors.

Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

    Its hard to gather information about myself because since I'm me, I already know.  It seemed redundant, but I definitely see the value for other projects.
