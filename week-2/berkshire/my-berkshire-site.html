<!-- 
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
It's weird having to start from scratch instead of being given a framework already.  I realized that I failed in the past because I tried to just write the site and didn't make my own framework.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
HTML is pretty easy to research because using tags is relatively easy.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
Its hard when you're copying something to try and not make it perfect right away, but we didn't do any formatting.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?
Its good because its easy to use, but from experience making things go right where you want them to can be annoying.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
Just remember the basic tags and look up the complicated ones.
