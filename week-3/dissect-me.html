    <h2>Introducing Command Line and Git</h2>

        Hello all!  I've never written any sort of blog before, so this is the very first blog post I've ever done.  This past week I've learned a lot of concepts that are brand new to me even though I am not brand new to programming.  That said, using the command line and the idea of version control are clearly very important tools that developers use when programming.

        Though I've used linux on multiple different computers in the past, I have little experience actually using and understanding the command line interface.  In addition, I wasn't sure how it was more beneficial to developers than just using a GUI based file system.  As I am beginning to learn, the command line is a much cleaner and faster way to manipulate and work with the files and commands that though possible, are slower using a GUI. Using hotkeys and typing commands seems to always be faster than reaching for a mouse.  Even in every day use, commands like ALT+Tab or CTRL+T to navigate your user interface can save a lot of time, and this is extended when you are able to maniuplate your filesystem without using a mouse.

        The command line opens up something very important to developers, which is version control.  In the past I have tried to make a website and seen that trying to keep track of the changes I make while testing them even on a small scale quickly gets out of hand. I found myself duplicating files over and over, and trying to use CTRL+Z repeatedly to try to undo changes that would adversly affect my whole site.  With Git, all of your changes are tracked.  You "commit" checkpoints which you can easily roll back to if you make a mistake. Any time you make a significant change or set of changes and are ready to test, you commit the changes and then have the ability to go to the live environment and test them.  If they are changes you like, you then have the ability to merge them with the known working version of your code and update that to be your latest working version.

        GitHub is a cloud service that interfaces with Git on your local computer to store code.  It allows you to keep a copy in the cloud just in case your computer gets tossed out a window or is set on fire.  This also allows for easier collaboration.  By default all of your code is visible to the public.  I won't go too much into the benefits of collaboration, but GitHub makes it very practical.

        Although I haven't been learning programming languages, the knowledge I gained over the past week was eye opening.  Before starting at DBC, I always said I didn't know what I didn't know, but now I do.  There are so many tools and best practices developers use, and version control is perhaps the most important thing I was never aware of before.

<!-- 
What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?

I like the idea of having a <header> tag, in past experience I was always tempted to put things in the <head> tag just because I wanted a header on my site.  I am also very excited about <section> and <article> because I am tired of <div>s!

How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

Each element is assumed to take up the whole width of the page and then the page is laid out vertically from there unless the CSS tells it otherwise.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?

I think snippets will be handy for code we reuse a lot, especially for some of the functions that are more complicated and harder to remember syntactically, so we can basically create a fill in the blanks loop or something.
