Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.

Creating a new repository on GitHub is easy.  The "+" button on the top right of the screen opens a dropdown menu where you can select new repository. 
This opens a new page allowing you to name the repo, add a license if you'd like, and decide if you want it to be public or private. 
After you create the license you want to open your terminal on your local computer. Copy the URL that GitHub gives you for the new repository.  In the terminal, type `git clone <URL>`.
This will donwload a copy of the repo to your local machine.

Describe what open source means.

Open source software is software that can be used, modified and distributed by people other than the original person who created it.  There are different licenses with different nuances around distribution
and charging fees, but in essence you can see the source code for the software and use it.

What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

I like open source for a few reasons.  
1. FREE
2. Things will improve faster with more people working on them.

Open source also makes me nervous because as a future developer, I need to be able to make a living off of the code I write.  If I come up with a killer app I want to be able to profit from it.

Assess the importance of using licenses.

In a world where everybody sues everybody else for everything, licensing is important.  It also protects the original creator, because although other people are using the code, licensing means you still hold the copyright,
which is the most important part.

What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

The biggest thing I learned was that all of the branches I have been creating still existed on my local computer even though I deleted them from GitHub.  When I reconciled the master branch,
it obviously (now) wouldn't include info about the other branches, so I learned how to delete them all from my local machine.


Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
I used `git help` quite a few times to learn a few commands I needed.  Specifically `git branch -d` and `git branch -D`, and the difference between the two. I am still looking for a way to use the subl command in cloud9.
I haven't found any particular resources that have been worth listing.
