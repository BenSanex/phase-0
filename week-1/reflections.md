#1.1 Think About Time Reflection
Independent study has many benefits for people that cannot dedicate the bulk of their time to the subject.  One of the main challenges is that you need to still find the time to study, in this case programming.  Though the flexibility is nice, we still have to focus in order to learn anything meaningful, and retain the material.  I studied 3 different productivity techniques and ideas that I wasn’t familiar with before.  These were the pomodoro technique, timeboxing, and meditation.

Timeboxing is where you pick an amount of time to spend on a task, and take small breaks in between each “box”. The pomodoro technique is a more specific version of timeboxing where you spend 25 minutes on a task and then take a 5 minute break.  I do not currently manage my time other than just planning ahead of time when I can fit study into my work schedule and then using that time.  Since Phase 0 will be more intense and scheduled than any self study I have done before, I will try the Pomodoro technique.  As I am writing this reflection I am finding that taking small breaks makes me more productive when I start writing again.  The breaks give me a chance to take care of the things that are nagging me, and then when I come back any writers block has left.

The unfortunate part of working retail is that day to day there are 3 different possible shifts I might have to work any given day.  While this gives me the advantage of being able to schedule things likes pairing sessions during business hours, it is difficult to block of a set amount of time each day for learning.  My biggest challenge during Phase 0 will be making sure I block out time to complete my challenges without leaving everything for my days off.
#1.2 The Command Line Reflection
A shell basically the user interface of the operating system.  BASH is a particular shell for unix like operating systems.  The commands themselves I did not find terribly difficult and it made me feel like I'm in Mr. Robot, which is cool.  My main struggle is reading the instructions from the man command because they use a lot of jargon that I don't know yet.  It's hard to say what commands are the most important but pwd and ls, though simple, are like your compass while navigating through your system which is very important. man is also very important because it is difficult to remember all of the possible arguments and options available.

pwd - Print working directory, tells you where you are in the file system

ls - lists the files of a directory, by default the one you are in

mv  - moves or renames a file

cd - changes the directory you are in

../ - moves you up a level

touch - creates an empty file

mkdir - creates a directory

less - allows you to view the contents of a file

rmdir - removes a directory

rm - removes a target, BE CAREFUL WITH RM -RF

help - displays the available commands

#1.4 Forking and Cloning Reflection

To create a new repo, you simply use the "+" button on github and select "New Repository".  After selecting the appropriate options such as public/private you will have a new repo on your account.

The fork a repo you find the repo you want to be able to edit and click the "Fork" button towards the top right of the screen.  This will Fork a copy of the repo to your account so you can make changes and potentially push them back to where you forked them from.

In order to clone a repo, you copy the URL from the repo in your account to the clipboard.  There is a copy button available on GitHub above the file listing.  After copying the URL, using the command line you navigate to the folder where you want to add the repo and type git clone [URL] and it will download a copy to your computer.

I didn't encounter any error setting everything up.  My biggest struggle was trying to find out how to remove the exploration repo that I had forked so I could do it again.  The warning messages on GitHub made me hesitate before deleting it.
