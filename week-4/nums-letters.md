What is an integer? What is a float?

An integer is a number with no decimals, a float is a number with a decimal.

What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?

When dividing with integers, if the number isn't an integer is rounds down to the nearest integer, with floats it will include the decimals. It is important in programming because
sometimes you are dealing with numbers of things that wouldn't make sense to have a decimal, like people.

2.3.0 :002 > p 24 * 365
8760
 => 8760 
2.3.0 :003 > p 60 * 24 * 365 * 10                                                                                                                                                         
5256000
 => 5256000
